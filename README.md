general ideas for the webapp:

***TASKBAR***
On the left taskbar, it should give you relevant stats (balance, block etc...). There should be a button that will connect to your wallet to display your stats and NFTs, but there should also be a separate button and field where you can connect to a different wallet and display it's stats/NFTs.

the taskbar should be static on the left side of the page

***NFT VIEWER***
I want the images in a grid. The grid should ONLY consist of images (i.e. no text). on hover, the images should expand, and the neighbour images (up to 2 grid spaces away) should shrink. (closest neighbour shrinks 75%, next closest 50%, next closest 25%..).
On hover the image data shows up around the image (i.e. NFT name, floor price on opensea...)
